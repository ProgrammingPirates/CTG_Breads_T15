A cultural force for over fifty years, Crosby faced an uncertain future after the 2015 dissolution of Crosby, Stills and Nash. Racked with health issues and personal obstacles, Crosby forged a new path at the age of 76. Seeking out younger musicians and recording a pair of critically-praised new albums, Crosby now sets out to make a mark in a world now so different from the generation he came to define in the 60's. With unflinching honesty, self-examination, regret, fear, exuberance and an unshakable belief in family and the transformative nature of music, Crosby shares his often-challenging journey with humor and bite. This inspirational story, filled with music, will speak to loyal fans, and legions of new ones.", "hasITunesExtras":true},

A petty thief in strife-torn '70s Belfast, Gerry's main interests are getting drunk and partying, much to the dismay of his quiet, frail father Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite). When Gerry angers the IRA, his father sends him to England, where his antics land him in the wrong place at the wrong time. Innocent, but forced to confess to a savage terrorist bombing, he is sentenced to life imprisonment as one of the \"Guildford Four.\" An innocent Giuseppe is also arrested and jailed, and while behind bars, Gerry slowly learns that his father's seeming weakness masks an unmatched inner strength and wisdom. Working with a fiercely dedicated lawyer (Thompson), Gerry determines to prove his innocence, clear his father's name and expose the truth behind one of the most shameful legal events in recent history."},

Starring Daniel Auteuil (Jean De Florette) and Sebastian Koch (Homeland, The Life of Others). In 1982, André Bamberski (Daniel Auteuil) learns about the death of his 14-year-old daughter, Kalinka, while she was on vacation with her mother and stepfather (Sebastian Koch) in Germany. Convinced that Kalinka’s death was not an accident, Bamberski begins to investigate. A botched autopsy report raises his suspicions and leads him to accuse Kalinka’s stepfather, Dr Dieter Krombach, as the murderer. Unable to indict Krombach in Germany, Bamberski attempts to take the trial to France, where he will dedicate his life to Kalinka’s justice and the imprisonment of Krombach. Based on the true Kalinka Bamberski case, In Her Name follows the three-decade battle faced by a father to bring his daughter’s murderer to justice. Faced with challenges from the French and German legal systems, Bamberski’s story is one of perseverance and obsessive determination."},

During his time in the OHL, Rich developed a crippling addiction to drugs and alcohol, which threatened to derail both his personal life and professional career. Shortly after debuting in the NHL with the Los Angeles Kings, Rich made the choice to get sober, embarking on a wild journey to the rehab clinic back home in Canada, from his brother's dormitory in Worcester, Massachusetts.

After converting to Islam and forging close ties with Malcolm X and Elijah Muhammad, Cassius changed his name to Muhammad Ali, beat Liston again, and defended his championship seven more times before being stripped of his title in 1967 for refusing to be drafted into the Army to fight in Vietnam. Exonerated after three long years, Ali returned to the ring in 1970, where he pummeled Jerry Quarry and Oscar Bonavena before agreeing to a \"Fight of the Century\" in New York's Madison Square Garden against the unbeaten Joe Frazier."},

The loss jeopardizes a Frazier rematch, but a recommitted Ali beats Norton in a second bout, setting up an encore with Frazier, who was dethroned by George Foreman earlier that year. This time, Ali beats his nemesis, with his reward being the 1974 \"Rumble in the Jungle\" with Foreman in Zaire. Against all odds, Ali KOs an exhausted Foreman to regain the heavyweight title, and becomes an idol around the world. Another epic victory over Frazier, 1975's \"Thrilla in Manilla,\" follows, but the toll of so many brutal fights starts to show. After several up-and-down bouts (and retirements), Ali vows to return to the ring, and in December 1981 he loses badly to Trevor Berbick. Finally, Ali retires for good and The Greatest travels the world as a goodwill ambassador."},

"longDescription":"What does a name signify, exactly? Growing up in Durham, North Carolina, white filmmaker Macky Alston never questioned why all of the other Alstons at his elementary school were black. Twenty-five years later, Alston decides to unravel this perplexity in the award-winning documentary Family Name. Alston's quest to solve his genealogical mystery takes him from New York to Alabama and then back to North Carolina. He seeks clues at family reunions, graveyards, church services, and, eventually, the original Alston plantations. The people he meets vary markedly in race, age, class and perspective, but they all have two things in common: the family name and a compelling story to tell. The biggest question of this investigation, perhaps, is whether it will provide the Alstons with catharsis or create an even greater sense of division. As the revelations mount, Family Name unfolds an unforgettable emotional journey that transforms our conceptions of the past. Recipient of the Sundance Film Festival Freedom of Expression Award and myriad other accolades, Family Name is not only a provocative meditation on race in America, but also a poignant portrait of what it is that constitutes 'family.'"},

"longDescription":"Robert Woods (Johnny Colt, Seven Guns for the MacGregors) stars as the eponymous Mexican gunslinger in My Names is Pecos, an action-packed, revenge-fueled western directed by Maurizio Lucidi (Motel of Fear). Pecos Martinez returns to his hometown, determined to settle a long-standing score with Joe Clane (Pier Paolo Capponi, The Cat O' Nine Tails), the gangster who wiped out his entire family and now holds the entire town in a vicelike grip. But Clane has other concerns - namely the sum of money stolen from him by one of his own men after a recent bank heist. They say it's never wise to antagonize a desperate man, and Pecos' return soon sets him and Clane on a collision course from which only one man can possibly emerge victorious... With a suave, laconic screen presence to rival Franco Nero's Django and Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name, Woods' Pecos was an instant hit with audiences, and the film's success spawned a sequel, Pecos Cleans Up, again directed by Lucidi and with Woods in the lead role. Co-starring Lucia Modugno (The Girl Who Knew Too Much) and George Eastman (Rabid Dogs), My Name is Pecos is a thrilling, timeless example of the western genre, shot through with striking visuals and nihilistic violence."},

"longDescription":"Ten-year-old Jo spends her days along the Shenandoah River with her best friend Selma, fishing, scrapping for metal—surviving. Her only comfort is an old CD left her by her deceased mother, a folk album by her father Johnny Alvarez. She spends her nights listening to it, longing to meet a man she’s never met. She gets her chance when Bill, her abusive junkie stepdad, overdoses on heroine. She's unfazed at first, same stuff different day, but soon the money runs out, and his body begins to smell. She dumps him in the river, and flees when the cops come looking for answers. Selma in tow, she steals Bill’s beat-up Buick, hocks his tools and an old flatscreen for quick cash, and heads off bound for Los Angeles, in hopes of finding her biological father. As she journeys across the country, Jo must contend with trains, meth heads, unexpected deaths, a lost baby, and ultimately her own wounds."},
