# Technical Challenge

BREADS is looking for an Android App/Interactive Chatbot/Web App that would help identify the type of substance use/addiction (Ex. drugs, device or internet, alcohol, to name a few) a student has by asking set of non-judgemental questions to categorize and assist the counsellors in charge of running de-addiction / intervention programs. The expectation is that the DREAM programâ€™s target audience (youth/students) would respond to these questions and can also sign up for a counselling session or rehabilitation services. The nonprofit would also like to keep track of all those that signed up for the programs, monitor progress, and help identify the pockets of neighbourhood where the addictions peak. In the end, the collected data can be used to provide insights into the prevailing 
conditions in the working areas w.r.t substance use and addictions among youth above age 18, among others.
