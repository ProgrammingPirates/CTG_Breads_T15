Technical Challenge

BREADS is looking for an Android App/Interactive Chatbot/Web App that would help identify the type of substance use/addiction (Ex. 
drugs, device or internet, alcohol, to name a few) a student has by asking set of non-judgemental questions to categorize and assist the 
counsellors in charge of running de-addiction / intervention programs. The expectation is that the DREAM program’s target audience 
(youth/students) would respond to these questions and can also sign up for a counselling session or rehabilitation services. 
The nonprofit would also like to keep track of all those that signed up for the programs, monitor progress, and help identify the pockets 
of neighbourhood where the addictions peak. In the end, the collected data can be used to provide insights into the prevailing 
conditions in the working areas w.r.t substance use and addictions among youth above age 18, among others.
The nonprofit’s ultimate goal is this: The valuable data gathered from the target audience, and the relevant insights gained through 
these intervention programs, can be presented to relevant forums – government, educational institutions, civil society agencies – to be 
able to advocate and influence policies, and also to see actionable responses adopted by these forums/parties involved. 
If you have this question in mind – “How is this solution going to help the youth/students?” - here’s the answer: 
Students may or may not open up about their issues with addiction/substance use in a direct or group interaction. This is why letting 
them answer a set of well-crafted, non-judgemental questions on their own – will help them open up and seek help. While designing the 
solution, do think about innovative ways the student can be engaged to provide answers. 
Things to keep in mind while designing the solution: 
 Think about how to make the application, you create, accessible to the students. What are the ways the nonprofit can let the 
students know that the help is just a click away? 
 It would also help to assess approximately the kind of issues/addictions faced by a particular college so that the DREAM team 
can use the data to work with the college to create focussed interventions. 
 The collected data has to be confidential as students may be worried about being booked for substance use even though 
legally there is immunity for users who want to access treatment. 
 Think about this tricky scenario: Not all questions in the application should be mandatory, because the students are expected 
to offer the data voluntarily. The student may not ask for a call back or may not want to join a counselling session organized by 
a DREAM counsellor. In this case, what do you think the nonprofit can do to help such students? 
 Brainstorm, with your team, to see which other features and functionalities would help the nonprofit and the target audience 
achieve their goal.
